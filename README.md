# openaudible-player
After you use Open Audible to make a webpage of your collection, you can put this player in the webpage directory to listen to the books.

This page expects 
*  your mp3 files to be in the form bookname.mp3 in the mp3 directory
*  your thumbnail files to be in the form bookname.jpg in the thumb directory
These are where openaudible puts them when you create a webpage.

To use this player, call it with the bookname

     player.html?play=bookname
